## Abstract

We introduce DeeLeMa, a deep learning-based network for the analysis of energy and momentum in high-energy particle collisions. This novel approach is specifically designed to address the challenge of analyzing collision events with multiple invisible particles, which are prevalent in many high-energy physics experiments. DeeLeMa is constructed based on the kinematic constraints and symmetry of the event topologies. We show that DeeLeMa can robustly estimate mass distribution even in the presence of combinatorial uncertainties and detector smearing effects. The approach is flexible and can be applied to various event topologies by leveraging the relevant kinematic symmetries. This work opens up exciting opportunities for the analysis of high-energy particle collision data, and we believe that DeeLeMa has the potential to become a valuable tool for the high-energy physics community.

## Abstract

Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be significant sources of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) in the Universe as the Hawking radiation of the PBH includes light particles when the Hawking temperature exceeds the particle's mass. Once produced, as axions predominantly decay into photons, we may detect the enhanced photon spectrum using sensitive detectors. We introduce a new methodology by defining the time-varying decay process for particles to fly and decay over time on a cosmological scale. This paper provides the estimated photon spectrum and the flux under some simplified assumptions about PBH, 1) monochromatic mass spectrum and 2) isotropic distribution at cosmological scales. Future detectors, such as e-ASTROGAM, have great chances of detecting the signal.
